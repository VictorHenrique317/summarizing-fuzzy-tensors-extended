In addition to make, clang++ (or g++, deleting "#" in the third lines
of nclusterbox/Makefile, synthetic/gennsets/Makefile and
synthetic/num-noise/Makefile), and the Boost library (see
nclusterbox/INSTALL for details), GNU AWK is required to run the
experiments.  Most of GNU/Linux distributions have it in their
repositories.  The package is usually named gawk.

Executing xp.sh builds the binaries and reruns all the experiments.
