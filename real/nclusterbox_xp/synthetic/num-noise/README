*** DESCRIPTION ***

num-noise turns a "perfect" Boolean tensor fuzzy.


*** USAGE ***

Usage: num-noise dataset-sizes nb-of-correct-observations-per-tuple [nb-of-incorrect-observations-per-tuple]

dataset-sizes is a string of integers giving the sizes of the tensor,
e.g., "4 8 16" (here three integers, hence a 3-way tensor).

The arguments nb-of-correct-observations-per-tuple and
nb-of-incorrect-observations-per-tuple must be two double float
values.  They respectively fix the number of correct observations per
tuple and the number of incorrect observations per tuple.  The latter
is 0 if not given.  The more correct observations and the less
incorrect ones, the less perturbed the tensor.  The probability
distribution of the altered '0' (respectively '1') values is the
inverse of the beta distribution with the parameters
nb-of-correct-observations-per-tuple + 1 and
nb-of-incorrect-observations-per-tuple + 1 (respectively the same
parameters but switched).


*** RETURN VALUES ***

num-noise returns values which can be used when called from a
script. They are conformed to sysexit.h.
* 0 is returned when num-noise terminates successfully.
* 64 is returned when num-noise is called incorrectly.


*** INPUT DATA ***

The input data is read on the standard input.  It is a list of
patterns, whose dimensions (as many as in the tensor) are
space-separated.  The elements of a dimension must be comma-separated
unsigned integers.  Those exceeding the size of the related dimension
of the tensor are silently ignored.

That input can be every index of a cell of the Boolean tensor whose
value is '1'.  It can also be the output of the gennsets command.  The
dataset-sizes argument of gennsets would typically be the same as that
of the num-noise command.  Nevertheless, when calling num-noise,
setting higher values may be useful: it forces the noisy tensor to
contain elements (those with the highest values) that are not involved
in any pattern.


*** OUTPUT DATA ***

num-noise writes on every line of the standard output the index of a
cell of the tensor and its value, between 0 and 1.  Like in the input
format, the elements are space-separated integers between 0 and the
size of the dimension minus 1.  Notice that this is the input format
of DCE and a particular case of that of multidupehack or nclusterbox.


*** EXAMPLE ***

That command line noises with two correct observations per tuple and
no incorrect observation a 40x60x80 Boolean tensor containing ten
2x3x4 all-ones sub-tensors:
$ yes 2 3 4 | head | gennsets '40 60 80' | num-noise '40 60 80' 2
