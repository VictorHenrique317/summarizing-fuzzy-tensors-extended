*** Dependencies ***

To run, gennsets requires the Boost library to be installed.  Most of
GNU/Linux distributions have it in their repositories.  Simply use
your package manager to install it.  If you run Debian and or a
derivative (such as the *buntu), you must install libboost-dev.

To manually install the Boost library (for example if you are running
a proprietary operating system), this Web page may help you:

*** Compilation ***

gennsets was meant to be built with gcc.  However one can easily adapt
the makefile to use another compiler.

To install gennsets on a *NIX-like operating system, run (with
administrator privileges):
# make install

If you do not have access to administrator privileges or if you do not
run a *NIX-like operating system, simply run:
$ make
The executable, called gennsets, is created in the working directory.
You can move it to a personal directory listed in your PATH variable.
