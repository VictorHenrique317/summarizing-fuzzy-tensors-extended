*** DESCRIPTION ***

gennset generates randomly positioned n-sets of any sizes in a null
tensor of any sizes.


*** USAGE ***

Usage: gennsets dataset-sizes [n-set-size-file] [output-file]

dataset-sizes is a string of integers giving the sizes of the tensor,
e.g., "4 8 16" (here three integer, hence a 3-way tensor).

n-set-size-file is a file listing, on every line, the sizes of an
n-set.  If not given, the standard input is used.  The number of
dimensions of these patterns must be the same as that of the tensor.
E.g., to generate three 3-sets of sizes "2 2 2", "1 3 1" and "3 1 3",
it must be:
2 2 2
1 3 1
3 1 3

output-file is a file where the n-sets are written.  If not given, the
standard output is used.


*** RETURN VALUES ***

gennsets returns values which can be used when called from a
script.  They are conformed to sysexit.h.
* 0 is returned when gennsets terminates successfully.
* 64 is returned when gennsets is called incorrectly.
* 74 is returned when data cannot be read or written.


*** OUTPUT DATA ***

The elements in the patterns are integers between 0 and the size of
the dimension minus 1.  They are separated by commas and the
dimensions are separated by spaces.  Notice that this is the input
format of the num-noise command.


*** EXAMPLE ***

A file sizes.data contains the sizes of three 3-sets.  Experiment!
