In addition to clang++ (or g++, deleting "#" in nclusterbox/Makefile's
third line), make, and the Boost library (see nclusterbox/INSTALL for
details), GNU AWK is required to run the experiments.  Most of
GNU/Linux distributions have it in their repositories.  The package is
usually named gawk.

Executing xp.sh builds the binaries and reruns all the experiments.
