*** DESCRIPTION ***

nclusterbox modifies patterns, which hold in a fuzzy tensor, to
maximize their explanatory powers and selects an ordered subset of the
built patterns to summarize this tensor.


*** RETURN VALUES ***

nclusterbox returns values which can be used when called from a
script.  They are conformed to sysexit.h.
* 0 is returned when nclusterbox successfully terminates.
* 64 is returned when nclusterbox is incorrectly called.
* 65 is returned when an input data line is not properly formatted.
* 66 is returned when an input file cannot be read.
* 73 is returned when the output file cannot be written.


*** GENERAL ***

* nclusterbox called with option --help (or -h) displays a reminder of
the main options.
* nclusterbox called with option --hio displays a reminder of the
options modifying the Input/Output format.
* nclusterbox called with option --hu displays a reminder of "useless
options", detailed in the eponymous section of this file.
* nclusterbox --version (or simply nclusterbox -V) displays version
information.


*** OPTIONS ***

Any option passed to nclusterbox may be either specified on the
command line or in an option file.  If an option is present both in
the option file and on the command line, the latter is used.

The option file can be specified through option --opt.  When omitted,
a file named as the input tensor file + ".opt" is supposed to be the
option file related to the input tensor file.  For example, if the
input tensor file name is "tensor" and "tensor.opt" exists, it is
supposed to be the related option file.

The options have the same name in the option file as on the command
line.  Only long names can be used though.  Arguments passed to an
option are separated from the name of the option by "=".  As an
example, these lines may constitute an option file:

verbose
tds = ": "
out = res/out
max = 1000
ms = 100


*** VERBOSITY ***

Option --verbose (or -v) prints, on the standard output, nclusterbox's
current step.  That option must be given in argument a number of
seconds, such as 0.5 for half a second or, in the examples in this
file, 2 for two seconds.  It is the delay between two consecutive
updates of the number of input patterns whose modification has not
started and between two consecutive updates of the number modified
patterns that may still enter the summary.  Option --verbose indeed
shows those pieces of information during the longest steps, the
modification of the input patterns and the selection of the modified
patterns, unless the given argument is zero or negative.


*** INPUT FUZZY TENSOR ***

The name of the file containing the input fuzzy tensor is passed as an
argument to nclusterbox.  If omitted, /dev/stdin is used.

Every line must be either empty (it is ignored) or contain n + 1
fields, n sets of elements of each of the dimensions of an n-way fuzzy
tensor, and a number in [0, 1].  That number, a float, is the
membership degree associated with every n-tuple in the Cartesian
product of the n first fields.  Those first fields often have single
elements.  They index one cell and the value in it follows.  Every
n-tuple that is undefined in the input tensor is associated with a
null membership degree.  If the membership degree of an n-tuple is
defined several times, only the first definition holds.

It is common as well to only have Boolean values.  Since no n-tuple
with a null membership degree needs to be input, the last field may be
always 1.  Option --boolean (-b) implicitly adds those 1.  The input
lines must then be either empty (they are ignored) or only contain the
n first fields.

Several different characters may be used to separate the fields.  The
same goes for the separations of the elements of any of the n first
fields.  The elements can be any string not including any of the
separatoring characters.  They must be all distinct.  Let us take an
example.  This line stands for the two 3-tuples in the Cartesian
product of {01-09-2007}, {Thomas, Harry}, and {basketball}, both
associated with the membership degree 0.1:

01-09-2007: Thomas,Harry basketball .1

Here, the characters ":" or/and " " separate the dimensions and the
membership degree.  "," separates the elements of a same dimension.
Having several characters possibly separating the dimensions (or the
elements) is OK.  Options --tds and --tes set the sets of characters
separating the dimensions and the elements in a dimension,
respectively, or defaults (" " and ",", respectively) are used.
Assuming the file named "tensor" specifies the tensor with lines as
above example, (verbose) nclusterbox is to be called as follows:

$ nclusterbox -v 2 --tds ': ' tensor

There is, here, no need for option --pes because "," is the default
value, and option --boolean is not used because the last field
contains membership degrees.


*** OUTPUT SUMMARY ***

Output data looks like input data.  Each line starts with a pattern
followed by either its density in the input tensor or, using the
option --pl, its density in the shifted tensor (see Section SHIFT).
The elements of every dimension of every pattern are ordered by
increasing density of the related slices of the shifted fuzzy tensor.

Option --out (or -o) sets the name of the file where patterns are
output.  If omitted, /dev/stdout is used.  For instance, to write in
res/out the summary of the tensor exemplifying the previous section:

$ nclusterbox -v 2 --tds ': ' -o res/out tensor

The output dimensions are separated by a string specified through
option --ods (by default " ").  The elements are separated by a string
specified through option --oes (by default ",").

nclusterbox can append to each output pattern, additional information.
When called with option --ps, nclusterbox prints the number of
elements in each dimension of the pattern.  When called with option
--pa, nclusterbox prints its area.  When called with option --pr,
nclusterbox prints the residual sum of squares of the summary
truncated after the pattern.  The separators can be specified:
* --sp sets the string prefixing the number of elements in each
dimension (by default " : ").
* --ss sets the string separating such numbers (by default " ").
* --ap sets the string prefixing the area (by default " : ").
* --rp sets the string prefixing the residual sum of squares (by
default " : ").


*** DEFAULT INITIAL PATTERNS ***

nclusterbox starts with initial patterns.  It gradually modifies each
of them to increase its explanatory power until a local maximum.  By
default, nclusterbox modifies one initial pattern per fiber with at
least one shifted value exceeding 0.  That may require too much time
and/or memory.  Even if the default requirements are not prohibitive,
the same summary is often more efficiently obtained by modifying only
a few initial patterns.  Option --max (or -m) sets a maximum number,
in argument, of initial patterns to modify, those with the greatest
initial explanatory powers.  For instance, complementing our running
example to modify at most 1000 initial patterns:

$ nclusterbox -v 2 --tds ': ' -o res/out -m 1000 tensor


*** PERFORMANCE TUNING ***

Giving a smaller argument to option --max, which has just been
presented, is the main way to decrease time and memory requirements.
That may worsen the output summary, unlike the following options.

Option --jobs (or -j) sets how many patterns are simultaneously
modified, thanks to multithreading.  The default argument, shown by
option --help, is the detected number of supported concurrent threads.
A smaller number may actually lower the run time.  With the following
call, at most six patterns are simultaneously modified:

$ nclusterbox -v 2 --tds ': ' -o res/out -m 1000 -j 6 tensor

nclusterbox can store the shifted fuzzy tensor in a hybrid way: part
of it in sparse structures and part of it in dense structures.  Option
--density (or -d) must be given a float number in [0, 1] in argument.
It defines a threshold at which a denser structure is preferred.  It
is 1 by default, to minimize the memory requirements.  A value closer
to 0 (or even 0, to always use dense structures) may turn nclusterbox
faster, especially if only a few patterns are simultaneously modified.


*** SELECTION ***

By default, nclusterbox selects as many patterns as useful to
heuristically minimize the Bayesian information criterion.  Option
--msc sets another criterion: the Akaike information criterion if
"aic" (or a prefix) is in argument of the option, the residual sum of
squares if that argument is "rss" (or a prefix).  Summarizing fuzzy
tensors with many cells, the selection criterion usually makes little
to no difference: too many patterns tend to be selected for the whole
output to be considered a summary.

Nevertheless, the selection process is such that it makes sense to
truncate the output, especially at an elbow (if any) in the curve of
the RSS (see option --pr).  Anyway, for a faster selection of a better
short summary, option --mss should be used.  It stops the selection if
the number of patterns in argument is reached.  The first output
patterns using that option are not necessarily the same as those
output with a greater bound or no bound (not using --mss).  Indeed, to
heuristically minimize the selection criterion, shorter summaries
favor larger and less dense patterns.  For the last time (it is not
essential to read the rest of that README), let us complement the
command line to have at most 100 output patterns:

$ nclusterbox -v 2 --tds ': ' -o res/out -m 1000 -j 6 --mss 100 tensor

Option --ns disables the selection and the ranking: every pattern that
is built is directly output.


*** SHIFT ***

By default, every membership value in the fuzzy tensor, including the
zeros associated with tuples that are not specified in the input
tensor, is subtracted the density of the tensor.  Option --shift (or
-s) sets another constant, in argument.  It must be a float in [0, 1].
A larger constant focuses the search on smaller and denser patterns.

Option --expectation (or -e) subtracts to every membership value the
max average density among those of the slices including the associated
tuple.  For example, the membership value associated with the tuple
(01-09-2007, Thomas, basketball) is decreased by either the average
membership value over all tuples involving 01-09-2007, or over all
tuples involving Thomas, or over all tuples involving basketball,
whichever is the greatest.  That option amounts to considering the
histograms of the slice densities have been analyzed and patterns of
interest are not mere consequences of these histograms: positive
correlations between the elements of the pattern exist.


*** CUSTOM INITIAL PATTERNS ***

Option --patterns (or -p), followed by a file name or "-" for the
standard input, provides a custom list of initial patterns.  They
substitute the default ones.  If option --patterns is used, option
--max truncates the list: no more pattern is input after reading as
many patterns as in argument of --max.

The format of an input pattern matches that of the n first fields in a
line of an input tensor or an output summary.  For instance, this line
stands for the 2x3x1-pattern including the six 3-tuples in the
Cartesian product of {01-09-2007, 02-09-2007} and {Thomas, Harry, Max}
and {basketball}:

01-09-2007,02-09-2007: Thomas,Harry,Max;basketball

The sets of characters to separate the dimensions and the elements in
a dimensions are set with --pds and --pes.  Here, strings made of the
characters ":", " " and ";" separate the dimensions.  That is why
--pds ': ;' must be used.  Since --pds's default argument is " ", not
using option --pds would make nclusterbox understand the above line as
two dimensions including elements with the characters ":" and ";".  On
the contrary, there is no need here to use option --pes, because its
default argument is "," and, in the example, only commas separate the
elements of any dimension of the input pattern.

Any element appearing in some input pattern must be present in the
input tensor.  If an input pattern is not properly formatted,
nclusterbox displays a warning and ignores the malformed pattern.


*** GENERATING INPUT PATTERNS ***

The scripts slice-input, fiber-input, reduced-fiber-input-one-way, and
reduced-fiber-input define four different sets of initial patterns
that nclusterbox can modify.  The first argument any of those scripts
takes is the tensor file.  Nevertheless, only one simple format is
accepted: on every nonempty line, one single and always different
n-tuple followed by its membership degree.  Also, spaces must separate
the n + 1 fields.

slice-input outputs the initial patterns as defined in "Approximate
Bicluster and Tricluster Boxes in the Analysis of Binary Data", by
Boris G. Mirkin and Andrey V. Kramarenko.  It takes a second argument,
the id (starting at 1) of the dimension in which every initial pattern
contains one single element.  It optionally takes a third argument, a
minimal membership degree, by default the density of the tensor.

fiber-input outputs the initial patterns as defined in "Summarizing
Fuzzy Tensors with Sub-Tensors", by Victor H. S. Ribeiro and Loïc
Cerf.  It takes a second argument, the id (starting at 1) of the
dimension in which initial patterns can contain more than one element.
It optionally takes a third argument, the minimal membership degree
for an n-tuple to enter an initial pattern, by default the density of
the tensor.

reduced-fiber-input-one-way outputs subpatterns of those fiber-input
would output.  Its second argument is analog to fiber-input's.  It
optionally takes a third argument, to filter patterns: a threshold, by
default 0, of the product of the area and the shifted density that any
output pattern must exceed.  The (necessarily constant) shift is an
optional fourth argument, by default the density of the tensor.

reduced-fiber-input outputs everything reduced-fiber-input-one-way
would output if repetitively called with every integer from 1 to n, as
the second argument.  The expected arguments are the same, but with
the second argument removed.  Wasting more time, reduced-fiber-input
actually provides nclusterbox's default initial patterns.


*** USELESS OPTIONS ***

By default, nclusterbox can both add and remove elements to/from every
initial pattern.  With option --grow (or -g), initially present
elements cannot be removed.  Do not use that option!  Unless many tiny
patterns are input through option --patterns, forbidding elements from
being removed prevents the discovery of patterns with better
explanatory powers.

By default, every input pattern leads to at most one pattern that is
candidate to enter the summary, one with a locally maximal explanatory
power.  With option --intermediary (or -i), all the visited patterns,
from the input pattern to the local maximal (including them), are
candidates.  Do not use that option!  The resulting number of
candidates makes the selection take ages.
